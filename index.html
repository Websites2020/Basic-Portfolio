        <p class="p2">I'm from Cleveland, Ohio, but grew up in the Washington, DC area.  I majored in urban studies/regional planning at Cleveland State University.
        I'm new to programming, but have always wanted to learn how it's done.  I currently work at a consulting firm focused on managing the tarrif rate
        quotas of rice being imported from the United States into the European Union and Colombia.

        <p class="p3">My current skills are using ArcGIS mapping software and microsoft office.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="p4">What I hope to get out of this class is to be able to build my own web applications.  I think that would be really cool and I admire people
        who can do this.
