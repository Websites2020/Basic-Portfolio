        <p class="p2">I'm from Cleveland, Ohio, but grew up in the Washington, DC area.  I majored in urban studies/regional planning at Cleveland State University.
        I'm new to programming, but have always wanted to learn how it's done.  My interest in web development started a long time ago, but I never really got around to it.  I'm starting now because I just graduated from college and have some free time that I am deciding to spend on improving my design and problem solving skills.  I currently work at a consulting firm focused on managing the tarrif rate quotas of rice being imported from the United States into the European Union and Colombia.

        <p class="p3">My current skills are using ArcGIS mapping software and Microsoft Office.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="p4">What I hope to get out of this class is to take what I learn and build my own web applications.  I think that would be really cool and I admire people who can do this.
